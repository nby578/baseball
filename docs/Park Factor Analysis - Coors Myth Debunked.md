# Park Factor Analysis: The Coors Myth Debunked

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Executive Summary

**Conventional wisdom says "Never stream at Coors Field."**
**The data says Dodger Stadium is FAR more dangerous for HR.**

| Park | HR Factor | Risk Level |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Dodger Stadium** | **127** | **WORST - Avoid** |
| Great American Ball Park | 123 | Avoid |
| Yankee Stadium | 119 | Avoid |
| Citizens Bank Park | 114 | Risky |
| **Coors Field** | **106** | **Moderate - Acceptable** |
| Oriole Park | 105 | Moderate |
| Average Park | 100 | Baseline |
| Fenway Park | 89 | Good |
| Progressive Field | 85 | Good |
| Oracle Park | 82 | Excellent |
| PNC Park | 76 | Excellent |

**Key Insight:** Coors Field's HR factor of 106 means only 6% more HR than average. Dodger Stadium at 127 means 27% more HR - over 4x the HR boost of Coors!

## Why Conventional Wisdom is Wrong

### The Humidor Effect (Since 2002)

Coors Field installed a humidor in 2002 that stores baseballs at 70°F and 50% humidity (vs Denver's typical 30% humidity). This makes the balls:
- Heavier (more water content)
- Softer (less elastic)
- Travel shorter distances off the bat

**Before/After Comparison:**

| Metric | Pre-Humidor (1995-2001) | Post-Humidor (2002+) | Change |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| HR Park Factor | 1.566 | 1.291 → **1.06 (2023-2025)** | **-50%** |
| HR per Season (team) | 128.3 | 103.2 | -20% |
| Batting Average | .328 | .295 | -10% |
| ERA | ~5.5 | 5.06 | -8% |

### Park Dimensions

Coors Field has the **largest outfield** in MLB:
- Center field: 415 feet (deepest in NL)
- Left-center gap: 390 feet
- Right-center gap: 375 feet

The thin air that helps balls carry is **offset by having more ground to cover**. Many would-be HR at smaller parks become doubles/triples at Coors.

## Current HR Park Factors (2023-2025 Statcast)

### Danger Zone (Avoid for Streaming)

| Park | HR Factor | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Dodger Stadium | 127 | **THE WORST** - short porches, dry air |
| Great American Ball Park | 123 | Tiny dimensions, Ohio River helps carry |
| Yankee Stadium | 119 | 314ft to RF porch = HR haven for LHB |
| Citizens Bank Park | 114 | Philly hitter's park, warm summers |
| Angel Stadium | 113 | Marine layer gone by game time |

### Moderate Risk (Acceptable with Good Matchup)

| Park | HR Factor | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Coors Field** | **106** | Humidor working! Much safer than reputation |
| Oriole Park | 105 | New left field dimensions helped |
| Target Field | 103 | Varies by wind |
| Wrigley Field | 101 | **Check wind daily** - huge swing |
| Truist Park | 100 | Neutral |

### Favorable (Good for Streaming)

| Park | HR Factor | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| T-Mobile Park | 89 | Marine layer, roof often closed |
| Kauffman Stadium | 88 | Deep alleys, fountain wind |
| Tropicana Field | 87 | Indoor, consistent |
| Progressive Field | 85 | Lake Erie wind |
| Oracle Park | 82 | Marine layer, triples alley |
| PNC Park | **76** | **SAFEST** - deep, river breeze |

## Fantasy Baseball Implications (BLJ X Scoring: -13 HR)

### The Math

With -13 points per HR allowed:

| Park | HR Factor | Extra HR per 7 IP | Points Lost |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Dodger Stadium | 127 | +0.27 | **-3.5 pts** |
| Great American | 123 | +0.23 | -3.0 pts |
| Yankee Stadium | 119 | +0.19 | -2.5 pts |
| Coors Field | 106 | +0.06 | **-0.8 pts** |
| PNC Park | 76 | -0.24 | +3.1 pts |

**Conclusion:** Streaming at Coors costs you about 0.8 points per start in expected HR damage. Streaming at Dodger Stadium costs 3.5 points - **over 4x worse!**

### Contrarian Edge

Because everyone AVOIDS Coors streamers:
1. **Lower snipe risk** - Other managers won't grab your target
2. **Better availability** - More options remain on waivers
3. **Overreaction premium** - Pitchers coming off Coors starts are unfairly discounted

## Early Season Strategy (Before Current-Year Data)

For the first 1-2 months when current-year HR data isn't reliable:

### Use These Metrics (in priority order)

1. **3-Year Rolling Statcast Park Factors** (most reliable)
   - Source: [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/leaderboard/statcast-park-factors)

2. **5-Year Historical Average** (smooths out flukes)
   - Average the last 5 years' HR factors

3. **FanGraphs Park Factors** (Guts! page)
   - Source: [FanGraphs Guts!](https://www.fangraphs.com/guts.aspx?type=pf&season=2025&teamid=0)

4. **Physical Park Characteristics** (don't change)
   - Dimensions, altitude, typical weather patterns
   - Roof (dome vs open air)
   - Marine layer presence

### Red Flags (Structural Features That Won't Change)

| Feature | Parks | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Short RF porch | NYY (314ft), CIN (325ft) | LHB pull HRs easily |
| Low altitude + warm | LAD, PHI, TEX | Ball carries |
| No marine layer | LAD, LAA (evenings) | Ball carries at night |

### Green Flags (Structural Features That Won't Change)

| Feature | Parks | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Deep OF | COL (415ct), PIT (410ct) | More room = fewer HR |
| Marine layer | SF, SD, SEA | Ball dies at night |
| Indoor/Dome | TBR, MIL, ARI | Consistent, usually pitcher-friendly |
| Cold early season | CLE, DET, MIN | Ball doesn't carry in April |

## Validation Checklist

Before trusting any park factor, verify:

1. **Sample size adequate?** - Need 3+ years or 500+ PA
2. **Recent changes?** - Fence moves, humidor additions
3. **Current year available?** - Switch to current-year data by June
4. **Weather extreme today?** - Check HRFI for game-day override

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dodger Stadium is the #1 park to avoid** (HR factor 127), not Coors
2. **Coors Field (106) is safer than 5 other parks** including Yankee Stadium
3. **The humidor cut Coors HR by 50%** since 2002
4. **Conventional wisdom is 20+ years outdated**
5. **Contrarian edge exists** - less snipe risk at Coors
