# Mastering H2H points leagues: A draft strategy guide

**Your league's unusual scoring—punishing home runs allowed at -13, rewarding holds at 82% of saves, and paying +3 per walk with no at-bat penalty—creates substantial exploitable edges that standard rankings miss.** The optimal approach combines the consensus points league wisdom (go hitter-heavy early, prioritize floor over ceiling, ignore ADP built for roto) with targeted adjustments for your scoring quirks: stack groundball pitchers, treat elite setup men like discount closers, and aggressively target patient hitters regardless of batting average.

## Points leagues demand a fundamentally different mindset

The single most important strategic shift from rotisserie to H2H points is that **category balance becomes irrelevant**—you're maximizing total points, period. This changes player valuations dramatically.

FantasyPros' 2025-2026 analysis states it plainly: "Punting is pointless in a points league. All you're looking for is who is scoring the most points." FTN Fantasy's Adam Young adds the critical insight that you should evaluate **points per game** rather than total projected points—a player who averages 2.4 PPG over 127 games beats one averaging 2.0 PPG over 155 games.

**Stolen bases lose most of their value.** José Caballero finished 4th in MLB with 44 steals in 2024 but ranked outside the top 120 hitters in total fantasy points. Meanwhile, **strikeouts become killers**—Eugenio Suárez's 176 strikeouts (27.5% rate) cost him 176 points in leagues penalizing -1 per K. This elevates contact-oriented, high-OBP players while punishing volatile sluggers. FantasyPros explicitly recommends Elly De La Cruz more highly for roto than H2H because his streakiness causes week-to-week losses despite elite end-of-season totals.

The expert consensus from FantraxHQ, Pitcher List, Razzball, and FTN Fantasy converges on one core principle: **go hitter-heavy early**. FantraxHQ recommends "extremely hitter-heavy" drafting with "up to a handful of pitchers in the first 15 rounds." Razzball suggests "draft hitters in the first 12 rounds, and take no more than 3 or 4 pitchers." The rationale is simple: elite hitters play six times weekly while even ace pitchers appear just once or twice.

## Your scoring quirks create three massive alpha opportunities

### The -13 HR penalty transforms pitcher rankings

At -13 per home run allowed versus the standard -5 to -7, a pitcher surrendering 25 homers loses **325 points** just from the long ball—more than double the typical penalty. This makes groundball rate and HR/FB percentage critical metrics that standard rankings underweight.

Target pitchers with **50%+ ground ball rates** and **HR/9 under 1.0**:

- **Cristopher Sanchez (PHI)**: 58.5% GB rate, elite walk rate, added velocity in 2025
- **Framber Valdez (HOU)**: Consistently 54%+ GB rate, 0.65 HR/9 (4th-best in MLB since 2022), 175+ innings annually
- **Logan Gilbert (SEA)**: Improved GB% every year, elite K/BB ratio, pitches in HR-suppressing T-Mobile Park
- **Reese Olson (DET)**: 50% GB rate offsets modest strikeout numbers
- **Carlos Rodón (NYY)**: Added sinker in 2025, generating "fewer homers, more grounders, more weak contact"

**Ballpark effects matter enormously.** Oracle Park (SF) has a 76 HR factor—24% below average—where "balls that leave the yard elsewhere die on the warning track." T-Mobile Park (SEA), Petco Park (SD), and Citi Field (NYM) all suppress homers significantly. Conversely, avoid pitchers in Great American Ballpark (CIN) at 118 HR factor or Coors Field. A groundball pitcher in San Francisco who allows 15 HR instead of 25 HR saves you **130 points** over the season—worth drafting him 2-3 rounds earlier than standard rankings suggest.

### Holds at +9 make setup men near-closers in value

With holds worth 82% of saves (+9 vs. +11), the traditional closer premium collapses. Here's the math: there were **52% more holds than saves** in recent seasons. While only 39 pitchers earned 10+ saves, over **100 pitchers earned 10+ holds**. Abner Uribe led MLB with 37 holds plus 7 saves (44 combined) in 2025—matching elite closers in raw value while being drafted rounds later.

Elite holds accumulators to target:

| Player | 2025 Holds | Saves | Combined | Key Trait |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Abner Uribe (MIL) | 37 | 7 | 44 | LED MLB, closing chances |
| Hunter Gaddis (CLE) | 35 | 3 | 38 | Strong ratios |
| Tony Santillan (CIN) | 33 | 7 | 40 | Dual eligibility |
| Tyler Rogers (SF) | 32 | — | 32+ | Consistent holds source |
| Jeremiah Estrada | 30 | — | 30+ | Excellent K rate |

**Strategic implication**: Don't overpay for Carlos Estevez's 42 saves when Abner Uribe's 44 combined SV+HLD generates comparable points at a fraction of the draft cost. Prioritize setup men on contending teams who see high-leverage situations nightly.

### The +3 walk premium with no AB penalty is transformative

This is your biggest edge. A player with 100 walks generates **300 pure bonus points** with zero downside. Standard leagues punish walks through at-bat accumulation (more chances for outs, lower batting average opportunity)—your league eliminates this entirely, making high-walk, low-average players dramatically undervalued by consensus rankings.

**Kyle Schwarber is the archetype**: His career 14-15% walk rate yields 108-126 walks annually—worth **324-378 points** from walks alone. He hit just .240 in 2025 but posted a .389 OBP with 56 homers. In standard leagues, that batting average hurts; in your league, it's irrelevant. Juan Soto (127 walks, .399 OBP), Aaron Judge (124 walks), and Shohei Ohtani (109 walks) should all rise in your rankings, but the real value comes from identifying players whose walk rates exceed their draft position.

Target hitters with **12%+ walk rates**:
- **Trent Grisham**: Third-lowest chase rate in MLB, 12.5% BB%—underdrafted due to low average
- **Steven Kwan**: Elite contact plus double-digit BB%
- **Yandy Díaz**: .290+ AVG with excellent OBP, extremely low strikeouts
- **Ian Happ**: .340-.360 OBP, 20+ HR power, consistent producer

## Snake draft strategy for the 11th pick

Razzball's analysis of 64 leagues found the 11th pick ranks among the least valuable positions—but the deficit is small (roughly 5% theoretical value loss). Your advantage at the 11/14 turn is **back-to-back selections**, allowing you to lock down two players from similar tiers strategically.

**Value-Based Drafting works best at late first-round slots** according to FantraxHQ, because you can identify true value gaps more easily than early pickers forced to choose among similarly elite options. At picks 11 and 14, target:

- **Two elite hitters** from the same tier (players ranked 8-15 are often interchangeable)
- **Scarce positions if value aligns**—first base is now "the shallowest position outside catcher" with only five clear top options
- **Multi-category contributors** offering power plus walks plus consistency

With two batter and two pitcher keepers, analyze how league-wide keeper selections affect position scarcity. If elite shortstops are heavily kept, that position's draft pool weakens; if aces are kept across the league, mid-tier starters gain relative value. Let your keepers inform priorities—if you're keeping elite pitching, go even heavier on bats in the draft.

## Does going contrarian beat following consensus?

**Evidence strongly supports trusting ADP as your baseline**, with targeted deviations based on scoring-adjusted analysis. Nathan Braun's Fantasy Math research calls Expert Consensus Rankings "the fantasy equivalent of index funds." The Wisdom of Crowds theory—requiring diversity of opinion, independence, and decentralized information—applies well to aggregated fantasy rankings.

However, FanGraphs' Mike Podhorzer warns against blindly following platform ADP: "One of the most common traps for novice fantasy owners is to draft based on ADP, leaving them unable to respond to the nuance of a specific draft." The key insight is that **standard ADP reflects roto league values**, not points leagues. Razzball explicitly advises: "Don't follow a platform's ADP when drafting in Points leagues!"

The optimal approach: use consensus rankings as your foundation, then **systematically adjust for your scoring**. In your league, that means:
- Elevating groundball pitchers 2-3 rounds
- Treating elite holds accumulators like mid-tier closers
- Boosting 12%+ walk rate hitters regardless of batting average
- Deprioritizing stolen-base specialists and high-strikeout sluggers

## Conclusion

Your league's scoring creates a clear strategic blueprint: **draft contact-oriented, high-walk hitters early** (Soto, Judge, Schwarber archetypes), **delay pitchers but target groundballers aggressively** when you do draft them (Valdez, Sanchez, Gilbert), and **treat elite setup men as near-equivalent to closers** (Uribe, Gaddis, Santillan). At the 11th pick, use your turn advantage to secure two hitters from the same tier, letting your keepers dictate position priorities.

The evidence suggests following consensus rankings as your baseline—but the consensus is built for roto. Your alpha comes from systematically adjusting for scoring that punishes home runs allowed at 2x the normal rate, rewards holds at 82% of saves, and treats every walk as pure bonus value. Players like Kyle Schwarber and Framber Valdez should rise multiple rounds in your personal rankings; high-strikeout power hitters and flyball pitchers should fall. Execute these adjustments consistently, and you'll exploit edges that your leaguemates drafting from standard rankings will miss entirely.
